Omeka2-Plugin-GeoChron
======================

Modification to GeoLocation.  Allows you to same multiple locations, with dates attached to each location, per item.


The Admin User Interface is setup to allow the user to enter the location by:
clicking on the map, 
entering coordinates on the address line, 
or typing an address on the address line.

The dates expect yyyy/mm/dd format.

The Public User Interface is not yet created.  I will do that sometime soon, but for our purposes at RICHES, the 
public map is not necessary because we have a map on the RICHES MI user interface.  See https://richesmi.cah.ucf.edu 

Email connie.harper@ucf.edu if you have questions.
